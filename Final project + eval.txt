START = 100 points

ESSENTIALS:
* 3D GL Core profile + shaders
* high performance => at least 60 FPS
* allow VSync control, fullscreen vs. windowed switching
* event processing (can control camera, object, app behaviour...): mouse (both axes, wheel), keyboard
* multiple independently moving 3D models, at leats one loaded from file
* at least three different textures (or subtextures from texture atlas etc.)
* lighting model, at least 3 lights (1x ambient, 1x directional, 1x reflector: at least one is moving; +possible other lights)
* correct transparency (at least one transparent object)

EXTRAS:
* height map textured by height, proper player height coords
* working collisions
* particles
* scripting (useful)
* audio

INSTAFAIL:
* using GLUT, GL compatible profile

NOTE: Hardware limitation might apply (eg. no mouse wheel on notebook), in that case subtask can be ignored.


Each missing (non-functional) Essential = -20 points (partially=-10)
Each working Extra = +15 points.
